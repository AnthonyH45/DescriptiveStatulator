# Descriptive Stats Calculator
A descriptive statistics calculator to run from the command line

# To use the Python version
- `python calc.py`
- paste in the data as either comma separated values, or whitespace separated
- hit enter and read the output

# To use the Go version
- `go run calc.go`
- paste in the data as either comma separated values, or whitespace separated
- hit enter and read the output
- # OR if you want to create an executable
- `go build calc.go`
- `./calc`
- the rest is the same

# Why? Who cares when there are better alternatives online? I have a TI-84 who cares about this nonsense?
Well, I made this as an exercise in Python and Go. I have been using the Python interpreter more than my TI-84 or other calculators a lot and I figured, why not automate simple things I often repeat. This is mainly a fun exercise that others might find useful, either using it or forking the repo, or cloning it and changing the code. Plus, why not make it easy for some people to just paste in some CSV values and be done with it!

# NOTE 
# The Go version ONLY WORKS WITH INTS RIGHT NOW
- yes, I will be changing that later, for now, use the python version, unless you want to use the Go version, then by all means, go ahead!

# Others online
- Here is a good online one that I found: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/descriptivestatistics.php
- Also, wikipedia has a lot of useful formulas if you want to program your own version!
